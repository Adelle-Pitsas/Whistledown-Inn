#Whistledown Inn
A one stop shop for managing bookings at your favorite mysterious victorian getaway. Users can login to their portal, view their upcoming and past bookings, review their expenditures, and make new bookings.


## About the Project
---------
This project is a solo assignment for the end of module 2 (out of 4) at Turing School of Software and Design. This project is a culmination of everything learned in the first 3 months of the program. Overall, this project took about 5 days to complete. This project's specific goals were to:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

###Technology stack
This project was built with:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack
- Mocha
- Chai
- Canva

###Context
I'm a student at Turing School of Software and Design. This project is the final assigment for Turing's second module, which means this project was completed about 3 months into my software development career.

### The App


## Getting Started
-------
### Installation
1. Fork this Repo
1. Clone it down to your machine
1. cd into the root of th eproject directory
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start and you will see a line similar to: `Project is running at http://localhost:8080/`
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the client side running
1. For the functionality to run correctly, follow steps 2 - 5 for this local api server: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api . Make sure to clone outside of the Whistledown Inn directory. Run this server in a seperate tab of your terminal.  
1. Enter ctrl + c anytime to stop either of the servers.

##Wins and Challenges
----
#### Wins:
- Learned some cool CSS to increase my UI (overlays, popups, dropdowns, animations)
- I had some fun planning the class logic and deciding where pieces of the logic puzzle should go
- Learned some animations with the login loading screen!
- Successful (and relatively painless) `get` and `post` requests
- Fixing, making note of, and solving bugs as they came up

#### Challenges:
- Formatting the background picture
- More than just a smidge of self-doubt about how I approached certain problems. I enjoy solo projects, but I love the more realistic group collaboration/mentor-question-asking environments more!
